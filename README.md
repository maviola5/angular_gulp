#Project Taskrunner

A simple repo to spin up projects, prototypes or applications.

Follow these couple of steps to get started:

    $ git clone https://github.com/maviola5/project_taskrunner.git
    $ cd project_taskrunner
    $ npm install
    $ gulp watch

Make sure you have both node.js and git installed and a global install of gulp

That's it! Focus on the bigger picture, stop sweating the small stuff.
